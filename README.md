# Java__Assessment

Q)What did you like about this project?

Good test of OO knowledge. It felt more like a learning experience than an asessment as I have gained a better understanding OOP and Java in general. 
This project is feasible and allows me to see application to working world coding. 


Q)What did you struggle with in this project?

Alot of time is spent on showing student summary and passed course option. Was trying to figure out the linkages and how to acccess different Hashmaps. 
Spent alot of time on the date error as well as initially input allowed invalid months and dates to be keyed while it is in the correct date parsein format, thankfully that is also corrected eventually with google search. However, I may have to do some reading up on inheritance and interface.


Q)What would make your experience with this assessment better?

Probably lesser spoonfeeding on the setup as i feel it may spoil the learning curve a little, since we usually learn better when we do more hands on coding.
I would have preferred to do option 1 and 6 on my own from stretch as well as to be tested a little more on inheritance and interface.
