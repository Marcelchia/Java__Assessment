# Java__Assessment

Q)What did you like about this project?

A good test overall. It felt more like a learning experience than an assessment as I have gained a better understanding for OOP and Java in general. 
This project is feasible and allows me to see the application to real working world coding. 


Q)What did you struggle with in this project?

Did not really struggle with this assessment as much as compared to JS assessment, but did spent some time on Student Summary and Date Validation. I needed to change the data type attribute for date to validation the string pattern format of date properly. 


Q)What would make your experience with this assessment better?

Probably lesser spoonfeeding on the setup as i feel it may spoil the learning curve a little, since we usually learn better when we do more hands on coding.
I would have preferred to do option 1 and 6 on my own with minimal setups, ie: let us do the respective class and sub-class set up on our own as well not to give the toString method away.
