# Java__Assessment

Q)What did you like about this project?

A good test overall. It felt more like a learning experience than an assessment as I have gained a better understanding for OOP and Java in general and allows me to see the application in the working world. 


Q)What did you struggle with in this project?

This assessment is much easier compared to JS assessment, but did spent some time on Student Summary and Date Validation. I needed to change the data type attribute for date to validation the string pattern format of date properly. 


Q)What would make your experience with this assessment better?

While I am thankful that i am able to complete this assessment, lesser spoonfeeding on the setups would be good. I would have preferred to tryout option 1 and 6 on my own with minimal setups. Could also let us do the respective class and sub-class set up on our own as well not to give the toString method away or let us set up our own getter and setter.
